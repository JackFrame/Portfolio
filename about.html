<p> I am Jack, I am experienced in using the computer and I took a class on how to use java script. I have made one project in scratch describing the brain.
I chose to enroll in this class because my mom suggested it and I thought it might be fun.
I was excited to learn how to use html and make a website. I dont have any plans so far with computer science in the future.
